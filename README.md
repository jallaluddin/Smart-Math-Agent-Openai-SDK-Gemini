Understanding the code as we are 5.
import nest_asyncio

What it does: This brings in a tool called nest_asyncio. It’s like a helper that makes sure our robot can do many tasks at once without getting confused.
Why use it: In Google Colab (where this code runs), sometimes the robot gets stuck when it tries to do things at the same time. This tool fixes that so our robot can work smoothly.

pythonnest_asyncio.apply()

What it does: This tells the nest_asyncio tool to start working and fix any problems with doing tasks at the same time.
Why use it: It’s like turning on the helper to make sure our robot doesn’t trip over its own feet when it’s busy.

pythonfrom agents import Agent, Runner, AsyncOpenAI, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel, set_tracing_disabled

What it does: This brings in special tools from a box called agents. These tools are like parts of our robot:

Agent: The robot’s brain that thinks and answers questions.
Runner: The part that tells the robot to start running and do its job.
AsyncOpenAI: A way for the robot to talk to a smart computer far away.
OpenAIChatCompletionsModel: A specific brain type for the robot to understand questions.
set_tracing_disabled: A switch to turn off extra notes the robot makes while working.


Why use it: We need these tools to build our math-loving robot and make it work properly.

pythonfrom google.colab import userdata

What it does: This brings in a tool to get a secret password from Google Colab (like a secret key to a treasure chest).
Why use it: Our robot needs a special password to talk to the smart computer, and this tool helps us get it safely.

pythongemini_api_key = userdata.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")

What it does: This grabs the secret password (called GEMINI_API_KEY) from Colab’s secret storage.
Why use it: The robot needs this password to talk to a smart computer called Gemini, which helps it answer questions. Without it, the robot can’t connect!

python# Tracing disabled
set_tracing_disabled(disabled=True)

What it does: This turns off extra notes (like a diary) that the robot writes while working.
Why use it: The diary can slow things down or make things messy, so we turn it off to keep the robot focused on answering questions.

python# 1. Which LLM Service?
external_client: AsyncOpenAI = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key=gemini_api_key,
    base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
)

What it does: This sets up a phone line (called external_client) for the robot to call the Gemini computer. It uses the secret password (gemini_api_key) and an address (base_url) to find Gemini.
Why use it: The robot needs to know where to call (the address) and use the password to prove it’s allowed to talk to Gemini.

python# 2. Which LLM Model?
llm_model: OpenAIChatCompletionsModel = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    openai_client=external_client
)

What it does: This picks a specific brain for the robot called gemini-2.5-flash (a super-smart part of Gemini) and connects it to the phone line (external_client).
Why use it: The robot needs a smart brain to understand and answer questions, and this line chooses which brain to use.

pythonmath_agent: Agent = Agent(name="MathAgent",
                     instructions="You are a helpful math assistant.",
                     model=llm_model)

What it does: This creates the robot, names it MathAgent, and tells it, “You’re a math helper!” It also gives it the smart brain (llm_model) we picked.
Why use it: We’re building a robot that loves math and can help with math questions, so we give it a name and a job.

pythonresult: Runner = Runner.run_sync(math_agent, "why learn math for AI Agents?")

What it does: This tells the robot (math_agent) to answer the question “Why learn math for AI Agents?” The Runner.run_sync is like pressing the “Go” button to make the robot think and answer.
Why use it: We want the robot to give us an answer, so we tell it to start working on this question.

pythonprint("\nCALLING AGENT\n")

What it does: This writes “CALLING AGENT” on the screen with some space (\n means a blank line).
Why use it: It’s like putting a sign that says, “Here comes the robot’s answer!” so we know what’s happening.

pythonprint(result.final_output)

What it does: This shows the robot’s answer to the question.
Why use it: We want to see what the robot says about why math is important for AI agents.


Big Picture
This code is like building a math-loving robot friend:

We get tools to make the robot smart and fast (nest_asyncio, agents).
We grab a secret password to let the robot talk to a super-smart computer (Gemini).
We set up a phone line to call Gemini and pick a smart brain for the robot.
We tell the robot it’s a math helper and ask it a question about math and AI.
Finally, we show the robot’s answer on the screen.

Why It’s Cool
This code lets you talk to a smart computer that can answer math questions! It’s like having a super-smart friend who knows a lot about math and can explain things to you.
If you want to try a fun question for the robot (like “What’s 2 + 2?”) or need help with something else, let me know!
